# pop2

Pop-2 is an AI programming language developed in the UK starting in the late 1960s.
There is a Wikipedia page about it.
It has a successor, Pop-11, which is still alive, and which as the Poplog system
supports Common Lisp, SML, and Prolog as well as Pop-11 (although not current
versions of any of them).  That's pretty impressive, but to my mind Pop-2 was a
simple and fairly clean language, and Pop-11 isn't.
There is published Pop-2 code, and there may be surviving Pop-2 code in archives,
so it would be nice to be able to run it again.
I am building a Pop-2 system as it might have been in 1989.
This is where the code will go.
